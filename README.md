# ROS2/micro-ROS adapter for T-motor's (AK Series) Robotic Actuators

This repo will contain codes to interact with t-motor's AK series robotic actuators from ROS2.
To enable this, I will create a teensy-based "adapter" based on micro-ROS.

## Folder Structure

- `./docker`: This folder holds all configurations of docker images used in development.
- `./teensy-adapter`: This folder contains the platformio project that is used to generate the teensy firmware.
